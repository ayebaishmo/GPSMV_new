# GPSMV_new - Game-Playing Strength of MCTS Variants

This project, **GPSMV (Game-Playing Strength of MCTS Variants)**, evaluates the performance and game-playing strength of different Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm variants in a game environment. By leveraging data science methodologies, the project aims to identify the most effective MCTS variant for optimal game performance.

## Overview

MCTS is a powerful search algorithm widely used in game AI development. This project implements multiple MCTS variants and evaluates their effectiveness in terms of game-playing strength using various data science approaches. The models were developed using **Decision Tree** classification, optimized with **Grid Search** to enhance model accuracy and find the best hyperparameters.

The results are evaluated based on several metrics to determine the best-performing MCTS variant.

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Place your training and testing data in the `data/` folder.
2. **Model Training**: Run the main script or Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to train the decision tree classifier and tune hyperparameters.
3. **Evaluation**: Metrics will be generated and saved in the `results/` folder for each MCTS variant.

## Modeling Techniques

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A decision tree classifier was used to evaluate and classify game outcomes based on the chosen MCTS variant.
- **Grid Search**: Grid search was employed to optimize hyperparameters for the decision tree model, enhancing accuracy and model robustness.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Standard classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, were used to evaluate model performance.

## Results

The project includes a thorough analysis of the game-playing strength of each MCTS variant. Summary of results:

- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% (replace with actual metric) based on optimal hyperparameters obtained via grid search.
- Comparative analysis and model metrics are saved in the `results/` folder for detailed examination.
